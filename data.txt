America is an exceptional country when it comes to guns. It’s one of the few countries in which the right to bear arms is constitutionally protected. But America’s relationship with guns is unique in another crucial way: Among developed nations, the US is far and away the most violent — in large part due to the easy access many Americans have to firearms. These charts and maps show what that violence looks like compared with the rest of the world, why it happens, and why it’s such a tough problem to fix.

1) America has six times as many firearm homicides as Canada, and nearly 16 times as many as Germany

This chart, compiled using United Nations data collected by Simon Rogers for the Guardian, shows that America far and away leads other developed countries when it comes to gun-related homicides. Why? Extensive reviews of the research by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center suggest the answer is pretty simple: The US is an outlier on gun violence because it has way more guns than other developed nations.

2) America has 4.4 percent of the world’s population, but almost half of the civilian-owned guns around the world

3) There have been more than 1,500 mass shootings since Sandy Hook

In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, six adults, and himself. Since then, there have been at least 1,606 mass shootings, with at least 1,829 people killed and 6,447 wounded as of February 2018.

The counts come via the Gun Violence Archive, which has hosted a database that tracks mass shootings since 2013. But since some shootings go unreported, the database is likely missing some, as well as the details of some of the events.

The tracker uses a fairly broad definition of “mass shooting”: It includes not just shootings in which four or more people were murdered, but shootings in which four or more people were shot at all (excluding the shooter).

Even under this broad definition, it’s worth noting that mass shootings make up a tiny portion of America’s firearm deaths, which totaled more than 33,000 in 2014.

4) On average, there is more than one mass shooting for each day in America

Whenever a mass shooting occurs, supporters of gun rights often argue that it’s inappropriate to bring up political debates about gun control in the aftermath of a tragedy. For example, former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a strong supporter of gun rights, criticized former President Barack Obama for “trying to score cheap political points” when Obama mentioned gun control after a mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina.

But if this argument is followed to its logical end, then it will never be the right time to discuss mass shootings, as Christopher Ingraham pointed out at the Washington Post. Under the broader definition of mass shootings, America has nearly one mass shooting a day. So if lawmakers are forced to wait for a time when there isn’t a mass shooting to talk gun control, they could find themselves waiting for a very long time.

5) States with more guns have more gun deaths

Using data from a study in Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mother Jones put together the chart above that shows states with more guns tend to have far more gun deaths. And it’s not just one study. “Within the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide,” David Hemenway, the Harvard Injury Control Research Center’s director, wrote in Private Guns, Public Health.

Read more in Mother Jones’s “10 Pro-Gun Myths, Shot Down.”

6) It’s not just the US: Developed countries with more guns also have more gun deaths

7) America is an outlier when it comes to gun deaths, but not overall crime

It would be one thing if the US happened to have more crime than other nations, but the existing data shows that not to be the case. America is only an outlier when it comes to homicides and, specifically, gun violence, according to data from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University.

As Zack Beauchamp explained for Vox, a breakthrough analysis in 1999 by UC Berkeley’s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins found that the US does not, contrary to the old conventional wisdom, have more crime in general than other Western industrial nations. Instead, the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that’s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns.

“A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,” Zimring and Hawkins wrote. “A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.”

This is in many ways intuitive: People of every country get into arguments and fights with friends, family, and peers. But in the US, it’s much more likely that someone will get angry at an argument, be able to pull out a gun, and kill someone.

8) States with tighter gun control laws have fewer gun-related deaths

When economist Richard Florida took a look at gun deaths and other social indicators, he found that higher populations, more stress, more immigrants, and more mental illness didn’t correlate with more gun deaths. But he did find one telling correlation: States with tighter gun control laws have fewer gun-related deaths. (Read more at Florida’s “The Geography of Gun Deaths.”)

This is backed by other research: A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence — a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives.

9) Still, gun homicides (like all homicides) have declined over the past couple decades

The good news is that all firearm homicides, like all homicides and crime, have declined over the past two decades. (Although that may have changed in 2015 and 2016, with a recent rise in murders nationwide.)

There’s still a lot of debate among criminal justice experts about why this crime drop is occurring — some of the most credible ideas include mass incarceration, more and better policing, and reduced lead exposure from gasoline. But one theory that researchers have widely debunked is the idea that more guns have deterred crime — in fact, the opposite may be true, based on research compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Center.

10) Most gun deaths are suicides

Although America’s political debate about guns tends to focus on grisly mass shootings and murders, a majority of gun-related deaths in the US are suicides. As Dylan Matthews explained for Vox, this is actually one of the most compelling reasons for reducing access to guns — there is a lot of research that shows greater access to guns dramatically increases the risk of suicide.

11) The states with the most guns report the most suicides

12) Guns allow people to kill themselves much more easily

Perhaps the reason access to guns so strongly contributes to suicides is that guns are much deadlier than alternatives like cutting and poison.

Jill Harkavy-Friedman, vice president of research for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, previously explained that this is why reducing access to guns can be so important to preventing suicides: Just stalling an attempt or making it less likely to result in death makes a huge difference.

“Time is really key to preventing suicide in a suicidal person,” Harkavy-Friedman said. “First, the crisis won’t last, so it will seem less dire and less hopeless with time. Second, it opens the opportunity for someone to help or for the suicidal person to reach out to someone to help. That’s why limiting access to lethal means is so powerful.”

She added, “[I]f we keep the method of suicide away from a person when they consider it, in that moment they will not switch to another method. It doesn’t mean they never will. But in that moment, their thinking is very inflexible and rigid. So it’s not like they say, ‘Oh, this isn’t going to work. I’m going to try something else.’ They generally can’t adjust their thinking, and they don’t switch methods.”

13) Programs that limit access to guns have decreased suicides

When countries reduced access to guns, they saw a drop in the number of firearm suicides. The data above, taken from a study by Australian researchers, shows that suicides dropped dramatically after the Australian government set up a gun buyback program that reduced the number of firearms in the country by about one-fifth.

The Australian study found that buying back 3,500 guns per 100,000 people correlated with up to a 50 percent drop in firearm homicides, and a 74 percent drop in gun suicides. As Dylan Matthews noted for Vox, the drop in homicides wasn’t statistically significant. But the drop in suicides most definitely was — and the results are striking.

Australia is far from alone in these types of results. A study from Israeli researchers found that suicides among Israeli soldiers dropped by 40 percent — particularly on weekends — when the military stopped letting soldiers take their guns home over the weekend.

This data and research have a clear message: States and countries can significantly reduce the number of suicides by restricting access to guns.

14) In states with more guns, more police officers are also killed on duty

Given that states with more guns tend to have more homicides, it isn’t too surprising that, as a study in the American Journal of Public Health found, states with more guns also have more cops die in the line of duty.

Researchers looked at federal data for firearm ownership and homicides of police officers across the US over 15 years. They found that states with more gun ownership had more cops killed in homicides: Every 10 percent increase in firearm ownership correlated with 10 additional officers killed in homicides over the 15-year study period.

The findings could help explain why US police officers appear to kill more people than cops in other developed countries. For US police officers, the higher rates of guns and gun violence — even against them — in America mean they not only will encounter more guns and violence, but they can expect to encounter more guns and deadly violence, making them more likely to anticipate and perceive a threat and use deadly force as a result.

15) Support for gun ownership has sharply increased since the early ’90s

Over the past 20 years, Americans have clearly shifted from supporting gun control measures to greater support of “protecting the right of Americans to own guns,” according to Pew Research Center surveys. This shift has happened even as major mass shootings, such as the attacks on Columbine High School and Sandy Hook Elementary School, have received more press attention.

16) High-profile shootings don’t appear to lead to more support for gun control

Although mass shootings are often viewed as some of the worst acts of gun violence, they seem to have little effect on public opinion about gun rights, based on surveys from the Pew Research Center. That helps explain why Americans’ support for the right to own guns appears to be rising over the past 20 years even as more of these mass shootings make it to the news.

17) But specific gun control policies are fairly popular

Although Americans say they want to protect the right to bear arms, they’re very much supportive of many gun policy proposals — including some fairly contentious ideas, such as more background checks on private and gun show sales and banning semi-automatic and assault-style weapons, according to Pew Research Center surveys.

This type of contradiction isn’t exclusive to gun policy issues. For example, although most Americans in the past said they don’t like Obamacare, most of them also said they like the specific policies in the health-care law. Americans just don’t like some policy ideas until you get specific.

For people who believe the empirical evidence that more guns mean more violence, this contradiction is the source of a lot of frustration. Americans by and large support policies that reduce access to guns. But once these policies are proposed, they’re broadly spun by politicians and pundits into attempts to “take away your guns.” So nothing gets done, and preventable deaths keep occurring.☰

Trump promised to end the "American carnage." Gun deaths are up 12 percent

Gun deaths are up over 12 percent year-over-year. Firearm injuries are up nearly 8 percent. The number of children under the age of 12 shot by a gun has increased by 16 percent, while instances of defensive gun use are up nearly 30 percent.

Citing "the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential," President Donald Trump promised in his inaugural address that "this American carnage stops right here and stops right now." But the numbers above from the Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit that tracks shootings via media reports and law enforcement records, show that in the first 200 days of 2017 the carnage has only gotten worse.

In the first 200 days of 2014, for instance, the Archive's team of researchers tallied 6,206 gun deaths, not counting suicides. Three years later that figure has jumped by well over one-third, to 8,539 fatalities.

Since 2014, total firearm injuries are up 50 percent. Shootings of children are up by nearly 30 percent. Reports of defensive gun use have doubled.

Trump's rhetoric aside, there's little a president can do in his first six months in office to influence violent crime trends in any direction. The Archive also doesn't offer any speculation about what's driving these numbers. "We provide very little analysis, and that's intentional," the group's founder Mark Bryant recently told the Lexington Herald-Leader. "We want people to be able to draw their own conclusions."

Other research has found that the nationwide homicide increase of recent years masks considerable regional variation. In many major cities, like Baltimore, Chicago and Cleveland, homicides are rising sharply. In others, like New York, homicides are actually falling.

The Gun Violence Archive's numbers suggest that in 2017, gun homicides are rising faster in some cities than they're falling in others. A small portion of this rise may be attributable to more media attention and better measurement techniques. But in the past few years the Gun Violence Archive's fatality numbers have tracked closely with the slower, more deliberative data from official sources like the CDC and the FBI.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions has made reducing violent crime a priority for the Department of Justice. He created a special task force on the topic, charged with delivering recommendations to the Attorney General's office by this week.

Sessions has taken several concrete steps so far intended to reduce homicides and violent crime, including increasing the use of mandatory minimum prison sentences, boosting the use of civil asset forfeiture to take property from suspects before they're convicted or charged with wrongdoing, and threatening to withhold federal funding from so-called "sanctuary cities."

None of these interventions are likely to have a significant effect on gun violence. Research has shown mandatory minimum sentences have little deterrent effect on violent crime. On asset forfeiture, one recent study found that expanding the practice reduced property crimes somewhat but had no effect on violent crime. Cracking down on "sanctuary cities" may even turn out to be counterproductive, as research has shown they tend to be less violent than cities without such policies in place.

Research has shown repeatedly, however, that one of the chief risk factors for gun crime is the availability of guns: more guns, more crime. Under the Obama administration, perpetual fears of pending crackdowns on gun ownership (that never materialized) helped drive record numbers of gun sales, putting millions more firearms in circulation.

Under Trump, however, fears of federal gun-grabs have subsided, driving gun sales down as a result. If that trend continues, it may prove to have more of a concrete effect on gun violence than any policy his administration pursues.

Christopher Ingraham writes about politics, drug policy and all things data. He previously worked at the Brookings Institution and the Pew Research Center.

Post RecommendsThe argument, first at a gas station and then outside a home, started over missing car keys.

In the early hours of Monday morning, police stepped in to quell the dispute between Allen Cashe and his girlfriend, Latina Herring, at a Sanford, FL, gas station. Then hours later they responded to a 911 call for an "aggravated battery" and found Cashe arguing with Herring outside on the front yard of her home, WFTV 9 reported.

Just after 6 a.m. that day, the police were summoned once again, but this time they found a blood bath. "The scene was one of the worst scenes our investigators have ever walked into," Sanford police spokeswoman Bianca Gillett told reporters. "It was horrific."

Police say Cashe had shown up that morning armed with an AK-47-style assault weapon, kicked down the door and shot and killed Herring. He then shot her father and her two sons, 7 and 8 years old, who were sleeping on the couch. The 8-year-old subsequently died. Fleeing the scene, Cashe opened fire on two strangers, including an 18-year-old high school student waiting at a nearby bus stop.

That was Monday. One day before, in Cincinnati, OH, 17 people were shot at the Cameo nightclub when a “mini brawl” sparked gunmen to open fire on a crowd of approximately 200 revelers, according to WCPO Cincinnati. It marked the bloodiest shooting in the nation so far this year, according to Cincinnati.com and the Gun Violence Archive.

“The hospital was so crowded, all the seats were taken in the emergency room,” one local pastor told The Cincinnati Enquirer. “The emergency room was literally standing room only." The city’s mayor said the gun rampage marked “one of the worst days in the history of Cincinnati.”

Here’s what was so strange about the media coverage for the mass shootings that unfolded within one day of each other, and which involved 23 shooting victims: There wasn’t very much news coverage at all, outside of the local press attention.

For instance, The New York Times did not cover either gun rampage this week, according to search via Nexis. (Two AP articles were aggregated on the Times' website.)

Broadcast news coverage of the Cincinnati nightclub mass shooting and Sanford shooting was equally light, according to a review of transcripts in Nexis and Snapstream for the terms "Cincinnati" or "nightclub" and "Sanford." The Florida shooting was mentioned on broadcast news just once, on ABC World News Tonight on Monday. CBS mentioned the nightclub tragedy just three times, including during Sunday's evening news broadcast and again Monday morning during CBS This Morning and CBS Morning News. ABC ran two segments on Sunday on the shows Good Morning America and World News Sunday, while NBC mentioned the shooting on its Sunday and Monday editions of Today. The outlets appear to have moved on from 2017's highest victim shooting as of Monday morning.

The timid coverage of these shootings reminds us the extent to which horrific news, and specifically horrific gun-related news, gets quietly tabled and pushed aside.

Gun violence in America represents a raging health epidemic, but you’d never know it based on the news coverage.

That’s important because how can a nation have a debate about gun violence when even mass shootings aren't thoroughly covered as big news?

And please note this: Virtually all of the 23 victims in both the Florida and Ohio gun rampages were people of color. Is it possible the national news media would have devoted more time and resources to the Cincinnati gun rampage if it had occurred at a mostly white nightclub on a college campus? I certainly think it’s likely.

Meanwhile, what else would have triggered wildly different media responses to the Sanford and Cincinnati killings? Answer: any hint of a terrorism angle.

On that front, news consumers know the drill: When a mass shooting involves the possibility of terrorism, media outlets compete to see who can produce more reports and, usually, who can produce the most heated analysis. For instance, it sure seemed to me like cable news interest in the mass shooting at the Fort Lauderdale, FL, airport in January dropped when it became clear that the gun massacre was committed by a homegrown shooter unrelated to jihad terror.

There’s obviously been a normalization over the years for mass shootings, as the lacking coverage from Sanford and Cincinnati indicates. And who benefits from that normalization? The National Rifle Association and the Republican Party, which supports the gun group’s every radical initiative.

Of course the NRA and the GOP don’t want the press to treat gun violence as the health crisis that it is. And of course the NRA and the GOP do want to the press to casually look away as mass shootings unfold with random deadliness. The conservative movement is in favor of normalizing gun violence and of the media omitting context about the epidemic.

Many conservatives don’t want the press to constantly connect the dots between American gun rampages, or to chronically mention that roughly 100,000 people are shot in America each year. Or that each week, approximately 1,565 patients are treated in emergency rooms for firearm-related injuries. Or that among the world's 23 wealthiest countries, 87 percent of all children killed by guns are American children.

As of March 28, 2017, this year there have been:

-3,516 gun deaths

-6,748 gun injuries

-496 unintentional shootings

-71 mass shootings — Gun Violence Archive (@GunDeaths) March 28, 2017

Interestingly, just days before the deadly Florida and Ohio shootings, CNN.com did what more news outlets ought to be doing: It published a comprehensive piece that put American gun violence in perspective by detailing the extraordinary economic cost the country pays each year to treat our gun epidemic.

Note that the death toll is likely to rise in coming years because “patients are now more likely to die from a gunshot wound than they were even 10 years ago,” presumably thanks to the increasingly powerful and sophisticated guns being manufactured and sold in the U.S.

“To be blunt, instead of a 2-centimeter hole, you are seeing a 3-centimeter hole with more damage. And there are more wounds, so the team has to repair more damage," the study’s author told CNN.

Following the shootout in Cincinnati, where panicked clubgoers were forced to flee rampaging gunmen, the Cincinnati Enquirer stepped forward with a truth-telling editorial (emphasis added):

We hear a lot from politicians these days about the threat of a foreign enemy, yet terrorism happens every day on city streets around the country. This madness has to stop. Too many lives are lost every year in Cincinnati and nationwide to savage, mindless and inhuman gun violence. Mass shootings in America, tragically, are becoming too commonplace.

One way to address the madness is for the press to see the country’s gun violence for what it is -- a uniquely American epidemic.Yet another American community is reeling from a horrifying, fatal act involving a firearm.

On Monday, a gunman opened fire in a public library in Clovis, New Mexico, killing two people and wounding four others.

In response to Monday's shooting, Clovis Mayor David Lansford said, "We've been hit hard. We're a community that will get back up, but right now we're hurting."

This incident marked the 244th mass shooting in 2017, according to Gun Violence Archive. To put this into perspective, we are 240 days into the year. In short, the U.S. has had more mass shootings than days in 2017.

Gun Violence Archive defines a mass shooting as any incident in which "four or more shot and/or killed in a single event, at the same general time and location not including the shooter."

Data from Gun Violence Archive also shows there have already been more than 10,000 gun deaths this year.

By this point in 2016, there had been 234 mass shootings in the U.S., according to Gun Violence Archive.

With fervent 2nd Amendment-supporting Republicans in control of Congress and the White House, it's unlikely we will see much legislation aimed at curbing gun violence in the U.S. anytime soon. Even after a member of Congress was shot earlier this summer, the GOP has not appeared interested in addressing the issue with new restrictions.

But that doesn't necessarily mean the public isn't in favor of certain changes.

According to Pew Research Center, there is strong bipartisan support across America for policy proposals such as prohibiting individuals with mental illnesses from buying guns, barring gun purchases by people on federal no-fly or watch lists, and background checks for private gun sales and sales at gun shows.

Meanwhile, according to Pew, there are strong disagreements between Republicans and Democrats on issues like whether to let people carry concealed guns in more locations and to allow teachers and officials to carry guns in schools.Gun crime Mapping US gun murders at a micro level: new data zooms in on violence The Guardian is releasing a new set of nationwide data for 2015, which can be used to do analysis of how gun murder clusters within neighborhoods The Guardian found that half of the United States’ gun murders in 2015 were clustered in 127 cities.

We spend a lot of time talking about which cities see the most gun violence. But analyzing gun violence at the city level is very misleading. Gun violence is much more local than that.

The Guardian is releasing a new set of nationwide data for 2015 that maps gun murders at the micro level – down to the local census tract. You can use this data to do analysis of how gun murder clusters within neighborhoods in your city or state.

Our analysis was possible thanks to the not-for-profit Gun Violence Archive (GVA), which tracks shootings and gun deaths using media reports. This data set includes the latitude and longitude of each shooting incident. We mapped each of these geolocated gun murders to a census tract – which means that there’s a wealth of demographic data connected to each census tract, allowing you to analyze the levels of poverty, educational attainment and other factors in neighborhoods where gun murders happen.

This article contains the data we used to conduct this analysis. We invite you to download this data and use it for further analysis and reporting. If you use this data, please make sure to credit the Gun Violence Archive and the Guardian.



Using this data, the Guardian found that half of the United States’ gun murders in 2015 were clustered in 127 cities (Want to fix gun violence? Go local). We also found that violence was concentrated even further than simply the city level: census tract areas that contain just 1.5% of the country’s population saw 26% of America’s total gun homicides.

We appended a few other fields to the existing GVA data. Using the FCC’s Census Block Conversion API, we placed each incident within its proper census tract. With the census tract identified, we used the Five-Year American Community Survey 2014-2010 to find demographic information for the tracts. We also determined the land area of each tract with the US Census: Cartographic Boundary Shapefiles – Census Tracts.



We’ve also included a separate easy-to-use file of FBI murder data from 1985 to 2015.

OKLAHOMA CITY – Police are investigating a reported shooting in south Oklahoma City Saturday morning.

Oklahoma City Police told News 4 they responded to an apartment complex near S May Ave. and SW 68th St.

Police say one person was injured. Their injuries are non-life threatening.

There is no suspect description at this time.

The shooting is under investigation.Preliminary investigation revealed that the LAPD has been investigating numerous burglaries at the Pajarito Cliffs Site (PCS) county buildings, located at 1001 Camino Entrada, in Los Alamos, New Mexico. LAPD officers were conducting surveillance outside these buildings due to the burglaries.

Around 3:30 a.m. today, officers undercover observed a gray Jeep Patriot enter the parking lot near building #5. A male passenger dressed in black and holding bolt cutters exited the vehicle and approached the secured locked area. Officers in marked units with emergency equipment engaged approached the vehicle and gave commands for the male subject to stop and show his hands. The male suspect did not comply and ran to the passenger seat of the Jeep and the Jeep began to flee the scene. At that time, shots were fired by at least one LAPD officer.

The Jeep fled from officers onto NM State Road 502 heading toward Espanola. LAPD officers pursued the vehicle onto State Road 30. The pursuit continued on State Road 369 to US 84/285, and onto State Road 76. The vehicle turned onto Corlett Road and crashed. Two male subjects, the driver and passenger, fled on foot into a wooded area and were never subsequently located by the officers.

The Jeep was later identified as a stolen vehicle. It was towed from the scene and will be processed for evidence by the New Mexico State Police Crime Scene Team.

At this time there is no indication of any injuries received during this incident. It is believed that one PCS building was struck by gunfire. The specific details leading up to the shooting remain under investigation. The names of the officers involved will not be released until after all interviews have been conducted.Police roped off an area around Richmond Inn and Suites. (Source: Kelly Avellino/NBC12)

The arrest of a man Thursday led Metro Police to two other suspects, as well as cash, drugs and stolen guns.

East Precinct undercover detectives located convicted felon and fugitive Cedric Doss, 25, at a car wash on Doverside Drive. He was taken into custody on felony community corrections violations warrants.

Police searched Doss’ car and found 12 oxycodone pills, one Xanax bar and more than $1,400 in cash.

While drafting a narcotics-related search warrant for Doss’ residence on Oakview Drive, they saw 27-year-old Keaire Kirkendoll, who lives at the home, and 34-year-old Gary McCree enter and come out with a large red bag.

The pair drove off and were later stopped on Brick Church Pike near Bellshire Drive. A police dog smelled narcotics inside the vehicle, and officers retrieved the red bag from the trunk.

That bag contained more than 3 pounds of marijuana, a baggy with seven prescription pain pills, two handguns (both of which were stolen) and $9,450 cash.

In a subsequent search of the Oakview Drive house, police found two loaded guns, a small amount of marijuana and $641 cash.

McCree, of Gallatin, is charged with gun possession during the commission of a felony, felony drug possession with intent to sell and being a fugitive from justice for drug violations in Michigan.

McCree is in jail in lieu of $326,000 bond.

Kirkendoll is charged with gun possession during the commission of a felony and felony drug possession with intent to sell. She is being held in lieu of $76,000 bond.

Doss is charged with three probation violations. Police say he is facing additional felony charges.

SPOKANE, Wash. - Three men were arrested and charged with first-degree robbery after breaking into a motel room on E. Sprague early Saturday morning.

At 2:15 a.m., a Spokane Police officer came into contact with a female running barefoot in the 1300 block of E. Sprague Avenue. The officer was told by the woman that a robbery just occurred inside of her motel room. She stated that three men forced their way into her room and one of the men pointed a gun at her and her boyfriend. The two other suspects were armed with a Taser-type device and pepper spray. All three suspects left the room after a search and stole some items.

The officer requested more units and a perimeter was established. A K9 unit was brought in to help track the suspects, who were found hiding under a deck a short distance away. They were taken into custody without incident.

21-year-old Benjamin M. Bass, 25-year-old Nakoa M. Walker-Kellum, and 31-year-old Kenneth A. Brower were booked into the Spokane County Jail for first-degree robbery. Bass also was booked on a charge f unlawful possession of a firearm and he had an outstanding burglary warrant. Bass and Brower have prior felony convictions.Two people were shot dead Saturday at mid-day (Feb. 17) in the Treme neighborhood, New Orleans police said. Both victims were male and appeared to have been wounded in the upper body.

The killings were reported at 11:30 a.m. at the intersection of St. Ann and North Prieur streets, where one body was found on St. Ann and the other in the front passenger seat of a silver Nissan sedan. The passenger-side window of the car was shattered, pieces of the glass sprayed on the ground where officers had placed two of nine evidence cones deployed for the investigation.

From a nearby doorway, one woman cried inconsolably: "My daddy, my daddy." Another woman cried while sitting against a police car, and a third woman, as she was led away from the crime tape by relatives, sobbed, "No. I don't want to go nowhere."

Residents said they heard about six gunshots. Through tears, one resident reflected on the violence coming four days after Mardi Gras: "A couple of days ago, this was the happiest place in the world," said the man, who would not give his name. "Now every day we've got to wake up to something like this."

Police spokesman Aaron Looney said the car's engine was still running when police arrived. FBI agents also were at the scene to investigate.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Police are investigating a mass shooting outside a Frayser nightclub that sent five people to the hospital.

Investigators say it happened just after 2 a.m. Saturday at Club Bosses on North Watkins Avenue.

Three men, ages 29, 31 and 37, are listed in critical condition and a 34-year-old man and 19-year-old woman are expected to survive, police say.

"That’s scary. It is scary," said Mohammed Alkabsh, who owns the Valero gas station next door. "To me like, just crazy, you know? For something to just pop up like this. I couldn’t believe it."

The 24-hour gas station had about five customers at the time, and Alkabsh said they ran inside and hit the floor, terrified they could end up caught in the crossfire.

"People came in here running and started laying down in here," he said. "I mean, it sounded crazy to me."

There are four surveillance cameras outside Alkabsh's store, which he hopes captured something.

"I’ve been here for two years, cool with everybody, we never had no problem," he said.

The nightclub is rated 4.9 out of five stars among Facebook reviewers, and many have commented on the safe environment and security.

But next door, Alkabsh said he’s not feeling quite as safe and secure anymore.

"It’s kind of hard now just to feel good, you know what I mean?” he said.

Police haven’t released the victims’ names.

Investigators say the shooter took off northbound on Watkins Avenue in a black four-door car.

We haven't already had a moment of silence in the House of Representatives, so I would like to have another one. Thank you.

Every single person up here today, all these people should be home grieving. But instead we are up here standing together because if all our government and President can do is send thoughts and prayers, then it's time for victims to be the change that we need to see. Since the time of the Founding Fathers and since they added the Second Amendment to the Constitution, our guns have developed at a rate that leaves me dizzy. The guns have changed but our laws have not.

We certainly do not understand why it should be harder to make plans with friends on weekends than to buy an automatic or semi-automatic weapon. In Florida, to buy a gun you do not need a permit, you do not need a gun license, and once you buy it you do not need to register it. You do not need a permit to carry a concealed rifle or shotgun. You can buy as many guns as you want at one time.

I read something very powerful to me today. It was from the point of view of a teacher. And I quote: When adults tell me I have the right to own a gun, all I can hear is my right to own a gun outweighs your student's right to live. All I hear is mine, mine, mine, mine.

Instead of worrying about our AP Gov chapter 16 test, we have to be studying our notes to make sure that our arguments based on politics and political history are watertight. The students at this school have been having debates on guns for what feels like our entire lives. AP Gov had about three debates this year. Some discussions on the subject even occurred during the shooting while students were hiding in the closets. The people involved right now, those who were there, those posting, those tweeting, those doing interviews and talking to people, are being listened to for what feels like the very first time on this topic that has come up over 1,000 times in the past four years alone.

I found out today there's a website shootingtracker.com . Nothing in the title suggests that it is exclusively tracking the USA's shootings and yet does it need to address that? Because Australia had one mass shooting in 1999 in Port Arthur (and after the) massacre introduced gun safety, and it hasn't had one since. Japan has never had a mass shooting. Canada has had three and the UK had one and they both introduced gun control and yet here we are, with websites dedicated to reporting these tragedies so that they can be formulated into statistics for your convenience.

I watched an interview this morning and noticed that one of the questions was, do you think your children will have to go through other school shooter drills? And our response is that our neighbors will not have to go through other school shooter drills. When we've had our say with the government -- and maybe the adults have gotten used to saying 'it is what it is,' but if us students have learned anything, it's that if you don't study, you will fail. And in this case if you actively do nothing, people continually end up dead, so it's time to start doing something.

We are going to be the kids you read about in textbooks. Not because we're going to be another statistic about mass shooting in America, but because, just as David said, we are going to be the last mass shooting. Just like Tinker v. Des Moines, we are going to change the law. That's going to be Marjory Stoneman Douglas in that textbook and it's going to be due to the tireless effort of the school board, the faculty members, the family members and most of all the students. The students who are dead, the students still in the hospital, the student now suffering PTSD, the students who had panic attacks during the vigil because the helicopters would not leave us alone, hovering over the school for 24 hours a day.

There is one tweet I would like to call attention to. So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities again and again. We did, time and time again. Since he was in middle school, it was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter. Those talking about how we should have not ostracized him, you didn't know this kid. OK, we did. We know that they are claiming mental health issues, and I am not a psychologist, but we need to pay attention to the fact that this was not just a mental health issue. He would not have harmed that many students with a knife.

And how about we stop blaming the victims for something that was the student's fault, the fault of the people who let him buy the guns in the first place, those at the gun shows, the people who encouraged him to buy accessories for his guns to make them fully automatic, the people who didn't take them away from him when they knew he expressed homicidal tendencies, and I am not talking about the FBI. I'm talking about the people he lived with. I'm talking about the neighbors who saw him outside holding guns.

If the President wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and how it should never have happened and maintain telling us how nothing is going to be done about it, I'm going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association.

You want to know something? It doesn't matter, because I already know. Thirty million dollars. And divided by the number of gunshot victims in the United States in the one and one-half months in 2018 alone, that comes out to being $5,800. Is that how much these people are worth to you, Trump? If you don't do anything to prevent this from continuing to occur, that number of gunshot victims will go up and the number that they are worth will go down. And we will be worthless to you.

To every politician who is taking donations from the NRA, shame on you.

Crowd chants, shame on you.

If your money was as threatened as us, would your first thought be, how is this going to reflect on my campaign? Which should I choose? Or would you choose us, and if you answered us, will you act like it for once? You know what would be a good way to act like it? I have an example of how to not act like it. In February of 2017, one year ago, President Trump repealed an Obama-era regulation that would have made it easier to block the sale of firearms to people with certain mental illnesses.

From the interactions that I had with the shooter before the shooting and from the information that I currently know about him, I don't really know if he was mentally ill. I wrote this before I heard what Delaney said. Delaney said he was diagnosed. I don't need a psychologist and I don't need to be a psychologist to know that repealing that regulation was a really dumb idea.

Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa was the sole sponsor on this bill that stops the FBI from performing background checks on people adjudicated to be mentally ill and now he's stating for the record, 'Well, it's a shame the FBI isn't doing background checks on these mentally ill people.' Well, duh. You took that opportunity away last year.

The people in the government who were voted into power are lying to us. And us kids seem to be the only ones who notice and our parents to call BS.Companies trying to make caricatures of the teenagers these days, saying that all we are self-involved and trend-obsessed and they hush us into submission when our message doesn't reach the ears of the nation, we are prepared to call BS. Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been done to prevent this, we call BS. They say tougher guns laws do not decrease gun violence. We call BS. They say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. We call BS. They say guns are just tools like knives and are as dangerous as cars. We call BS. They say no laws could have prevented the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred. We call BS. That us kids don't know what we're talking about, that we're too young to understand how the government works. We call BS.

If you agree, register to vote. Contact your local congresspeople. Give them a piece of your mind.

(Crowd chants) Throw them out.One by one, students and staff members who survived alleged gunman Nickolas Cruz’s deadly rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School stepped up to a podium Saturday and railed against the gun lobby and gun laws that enabled him to purchase an assault weapon.

At times their voices broke with emotion or rage, but each person who addressed the Rally to Support Firearm Safety Legislation in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was united in their message: The shooting should never have happened.

Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student Emma Gonzalez began her speech with a moment of silence for the 17 victims who were killed Wednesday.

"All these people should be at home grieving," she said. “But instead we are up here, standing together, because if all our government and president can do is send ‘thoughts and prayers,’ then it’s time for victims to be the change that we need to see."

Reading from a speech scribbled on the back of her AP Government notes, Gonzalez demanded to know where the “common sense” is in America’s gun laws, and called out members of Congress who’ve accepted money and donations from the National Rifle Association.

She also had a message specifically for President Donald Trump, criticizing him for tweeting a call for action on mental health, while adding that he overturned an Obama-era law that made it harder for people with mental illness to purchase a gun.

"If the president wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a 'terrible tragedy,'" she said, "I'm going to happily ask him how much money he received from the NRA."

In the crowd, students held up photos of their classmates who were killed, and at times responded to speeches with chants of "vote them out," and "Rubio must go."

Douglas High student Sarah Chadwick, whose reply to Trump's condolence tweet went viral, carried a sign that read "we don't want your thoughts and condolences, we want policy & change."

Melissa Falkowski, a Douglas High English and journalism teacher, who hid in the closet of her classroom during the shooting, spoke through tears at the rally.

"They say 'it's not the time' — Now is the time! There is no other time!" she said.

Falkowski said she has made it her life mission to fight for gun legislation and to ensure that school shootings never happen again.

David Hogg, a 17-year-old senior whose message to lawmakers went viral after the shooting, said he wanted the community to channel its pain and frustration into voting out the politicians who support gun laws.

"This fight is not going to be easy. This fight is not going to be short," he said. "The people and the special interests who want to pass gun laws and make it easier for people to get guns are not going to stop — and we can’t either."

"Now," Hogg said, "is the time that we say thank you for your prayers and your thoughts but that’s not enough."

Trump, who made no reference to the issue of gun control in an address to the nation about the shooting on Thursday, on Twitter Saturday blamed Democrats for a lack of action.

"Just like they don't want to solve the DACA problem, why didn't the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn't want to, and now they just talk!" the president tweeted.

CORRECTION (Feb. 17, 2018, 7 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misspelled the last name of a student. She is Emma Gonzalez, not Gonzales.MIAMI (Reuters) - Student survivors of a mass shooting that killed 17 people at a Florida high school called for gun restrictions on Saturday during an angry and somber rally, but attendees at a nearby gun show said firearms could not be blamed for the massacre.

Wednesday’s shooting in the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Parkland fueled the long-running U.S. debate between supporters of tougher controls on firearms and advocates for gun rights, which are protected by the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment.

Both sides of the dispute were on display on Saturday.

Many at a rally in Fort Lauderdale that was organized to demand tougher gun laws rejected comments by U.S. President Donald Trump and others that mental illness was the main factor behind the slaughter at Margory Stoneman Douglas High School.

“We need to pay attention to the fact that this isn’t just a mental health issue,” Emma Gonzalez, an 18-year-old student at the school, told hundreds demonstrators gathered on the steps of a federal building. The shooter “wouldn’t have harmed that many students with a knife!” she yelled, shedding tears as the crowd cheered her on.

Gonzalez criticized Trump for overturning a measure implemented by former President Barack Obama that required extra scrutiny of some gun buyers with a history of mental illness. She also condemned the National Rifle Association, which opposes laws that it says violate gun owners’ rights.

“Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have ever been done to prevent this, we call B.S.” Gonzalez said.

Nikolas Cruz, 19, a former student who was expelled from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, has been charged with 17 counts of murder. [nL2N1Q709V] Police said he was armed with an AR-15-style rifle and had multiple magazines of ammunition.

Cruz legally purchased the murder weapon from a licensed dealer in Coral Springs, Florida, the Broward County sheriff said.[nL2N1Q50FA]

Representatives for the White House and the NRA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. On Friday, Trump visited a Florida hospital and met with people wounded in the shooting as well as first responders.

Ryan Deitsch, 18, was among those locked in a classroom closet as the shooter stalked the school’s corridors.

“The least lawmakers can do is vote on something,” Deitsch said in an interview at the rally, referring to tighter gun controls. “What’s the worst that can happen?”

The rally coincided with a gun show attended by hundreds of people about 40 miles (64 km) away at the Dade County fairgrounds. Despite calls for the show to be canceled, there were more than $5 million worth of guns and accessories on display, organizers said, including dozens of assault-style rifles.

Jorge Fernandez, a former police officer and show manager, said Florida Gun Shows, which runs more than 40 shows across the state, decided against canceling due to financial concerns.

Joe Arrington, 29, a former law enforcement officer, was there with his infant daughter in his arms and a rifle over his shoulder. He said more background checks are needed on gun buyers, but that more regulation would not have stopped the Parkland massacre.

“I don’t believe that any law that they would have added would have deterred what happened,” Arrington said. “I think a lot of agencies didn’t do their job necessarily like they were supposed to.”

The FBI has come under intense criticism after it said on Friday that it failed to act on a warning about Cruz that was called in to a tip line on Jan. 5. The caller provided information about Cruz’s “desire to kill people ... as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting,” the FBI said. [nL2N1Q60HJ]

Adolfo David Ginarte, 30, a hotel conference service manager, was checking out some of the more than 140 vendors at the gun show. He called it “un-American” for anyone to call for the show to be canceled in the wake of the shooting.

“Facts don’t care about your feelings,” he said. “Things are going to happen. Life is going to go forward. What happens if I‘m offended by a movie? Are they going to cancel the movie? This isn’t the first time and unfortunately it’s not going to be the last time.”Most national journalists seem to hate guns, gun owners and gun defenders. When the media report on a shooting tragedy they often go after all three.

The Parkland, Florida, high school attack on Wednesday was incredibly horrible. Seventeen people were killed by a former student known to both police and the FBI. The bodies weren’t cold before many in the news media immediately tried to politicize the tragedy.

Journalists mostly stuck to their script – demonizing guns and gun owners, getting gun facts wrong and attacking the National Rifle Association.

NBC News Political Director Chuck Todd noted how President Trump decided “not to address any policy ideas at all in his remarks” and focused on an “empathetic tone.”

CNN actually tweeted: “In Florida, you don't need a permit to conceal carry a rifle or shotgun.” Apparently, no one on CNN’s staff has ever tried to put a rifle (more than 32 inches long) in a coat pocket. And NBC’s Megyn Kelly tried to appease her new audience with an anti-NRA rant: “The NRA is too powerful, our politicians are too weak and the guns are too ubiquitous.”

Journalists repeated a false statement from the hard-left, gun-grabber group Everytown for Gun Safety. The group, “founded and funded” with millions from former New York City liberal Mayor Michael Bloomberg, pushed a disturbing claim about the number of school shootings in 2018. It was so outlandish that The Washington Post had to wreck it.

The Post’s headline was unusually honest: “No, there haven’t been 18 school shootings in 2018. That number is flat wrong.” The paper blasted the fake news, saying: “It is a horrifying statistic. And it is wrong.” It continued: “Everytown has long inflated its total by including incidents of gunfire that are not really school shootings.” The phony stats included one case where a man killed himself outside a school that had been closed for seven months.

The two networks battling for The Resistance viewers – CNN and MSNBC – fought to outdo one another on guns. As usual, CNN won.

CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer harassed Florida Gov. Rick Scott, demanding he fix the problem. “So I just want you to tell our viewers you're going to take action,” Blitzer told the governor.

Anchor Don Lemon said all Americans are at a big risk for gun violence. “Every single one of us is just playing the odds at this point.”

Anchor Chris Cuomo, from the Democratic family of Cuomos, declared: “You can’t deal with this issue without dealing with the availability of guns.” Then he pressed for gun control to be a Trump agenda item. “How can you not include this issue in part of that agenda?” he asked, seemingly forgetting Trump’s strong support of gun rights.

Over at MSNBC, the Thrill-Up-My-Leg Host Chris Matthews, spent nearly 39 minutes hyping gun control. That was more than twice the time he devoted to the actual shooting. And a network guest expert compared the Second Amendment to a “suicide pact.” “Morning Joe” simply wouldn’t allow pro-gun voices on its show.

Once again news that fit the media agenda was proven too good to be true. The AP reported: “A white nationalist appears to have lied to The Associated Press and other news organizations when he claimed that Florida school-shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz was a member of his obscure group.”

2. “The View” Hosts Attack Christians: An episode of ABC’s “The View” skewered Vice President Mike Pence so badly that a panelist claimed his Christian faith was a “mental illness.” Host Joy Behar, who has perennial foot-in-mouth disease, mocked Pence: “Like I said before, it's one thing to talk to Jesus. It's another thing when Jesus talks to you.”

The fallout was huge. Pence himself criticized the network, saying, “it's an insult not to me, but to the vast majority of American people who like me, cherish their faith.”

The response from the right put the far-left show on the defensive. The next day saw the hosts scrambling to pretend they weren’t bigoted. Behar claimed that if she thought that all Christians were insane, that would include her and many of those close to her, counting others on the show. “I don’t mean to offend people, but apparently I keep doing it,” she said, playing her response for a laugh. Then she added, “It was a joke. Comedians are in danger these days.”

Poor Joy. Life is so tough for liberals on liberal shows on liberal networks. But when the show’s lone conservative, Meghan McCain, tried to respond, she was cut off. Can’t have someone calling out Joy for her bigotry.

3. Gold Medal Bias: The Olympic love fest between American media and North Korea’s mass-murdering regime continued. All so journalists could antagonize Trump.

NBC, which has been acting as the propaganda arm of the Olympics, deflected criticism of North Korea. NBC News Correspondent Stephanie Gosk was oddly neutral describing the regime’s cheerleading squad. “Critics are calling them propaganda performers sent by Kim Jong Un to put a smiling face on a brutal regime.” CBS anchor Jeff Glor was more direct: “North Korea brought its own cheering squad, gold medalists in propaganda.”

New York Times Opinion Editor Bari Weiss caught flack for falsely linking U.S. skater Mirai Nagasu to the immigration debate. Nagasu landed an incredible triple axel (Watch!) and was the first female U.S. Olympian to do it. Weiss congratulated Nagasu by touting, “immigrants get the job done.” One problem, Nagasu was born and raised in California. Weiss defended her claim as “poetic license.”

Katie Couric, the journalist who delivered fake news about guns in a documentary and former co-host of the “Today” show, managed to remind viewers of the agony of defeat or possibly de-feet. Couric ridiculously claimed that athletes from the Netherlands do well in speed skating because, well, this is too good: “So as long as those canals have existed the Dutch have skated on them to get from place to place, to race each other and to have some fun.” Nope. Not true.

4. Celebrate President’s Day: Just in time for the annual holiday honoring presidents, we have even more examples of how much the news media hate the current man with that title. Or, as NBC Political Analyst Anand Giridharadas referred to Trump, "the commander in chief of American rape culture."

CNN Editor-at-Large Chris Cillizza actually compared Trump to former presidents, including impeached and discredited President Bill Clinton, as a moral leader. “I will tell you all modern Presidents, Brooke, saw the job, whether it’s George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, George H.W. Bush, they saw the job as sort of, in part, being a leader of the American people, taking the high road…” he explained, apparently forgetting the lying and Monica Lewinsky scandal.

5. Just In Case You Thought Journalists Were Neutral: CNN even oohed and ahhed over the portraits of President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle. No matter your feelings about the former president, the pair deserved better artwork. Still, CNN was there to hype. Reporter Kate Bennett called it “probably the most anticipated unveiling of presidential portraits and first lady portraits that we’ve had so far to date.”

The New York Times is still refighting the Cold War – for the communists – by depicting East German women as better off than those in the West. “Eastern women, who were part of the work force and with free child care, were more emancipated than their western sisters.” Maybe the Times meant “more emaciated” and it was just a typo.

Univision’s activist/journalist/Anchor Jorge Ramos responded to a possible immigration compromise with this “neutral” nugget: “I mean, do they really want to make America white again?” And “CBS This Morning” Co-host Gayle King, who gives to Democrats and doesn’t even pretend neutrality, is lobbying for her friend Oprah Winfrey to run for president. According to Oprah, King was repeatedly urging, “You should think about it.”CLOSE Several dozen students from South Broward High School took a public stand against gun violence Friday and for gun control.

Students across the country say they are planning to walk out of schools in protest in the aftermath of the shooting this week in South Florida.

The pleas and demands from young voices who survived the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., have brought new pressure to an old debate: gun-control laws.

A walkout in South Florida on Friday and rally in Fort Lauderdale on Saturday helped anchor support, and other protests are planned in coming weeks, including one that would mark the 19th year since the Columbine High School massacre.

"We are the students, we are the victims, we are change, fight gun violence now!" student organizers wrote for one of the planned events. "High School students across the U.S.A, the way to fight back is here. There has been too much complacency on the part of politicians when it comes to gun violence. The time to act is now!"

The first event is planned for March, 14, which would mark one month since the South Florida shooting. It's being planned in part by the Women's March organizers to protest inaction from lawmakers on gun-control legislation.

"We are not safe at school. We are not safe in our cities and towns," the Facebook event reads. "Congress must take meaningful action to keep us safe and pass federal gun reform legislation that address the public health crisis of gun violence."

The event calls for students and teachers to walk out of their schools at 10 a.m. local time for 17 minutes, to honor the 17 lives lost in Florida.

Another walkout is planned on April 20, which will mark the 19th year since the Columbine High School massacre in Colorado that left 13 dead.

More than 22,000 people have signed a petition, pledging to walkout of their classrooms that day at 10 a.m. for the rest of the day.

"Nothing has changed since Columbine, let us start a movement that lets the government know the time for change is now," organizers wrote in the change.org event.

Attention: All students, teachers, coaches, counselors, janitors & administration working across America’s school systems:



On April 20, 2018, the anniversary of the Columbine shooting, lead a peaceful walkout at 10am & peacefully protest this nation’s lax gun laws.

President Trump visited victims of the shooting Friday and vowed to tackle mental-illness issues, but many say that isn't enough.

“We want more gun safety,” said 18-year-old Kevin Trejos, a senior at the school. “It’s a dream. It hasn’t hit me yet. When I see empty desks, I’ll feel it. I’m numb now.”

Organizers of the events say they hope the protests will gain attention and show lawmakers these issues aren't going away and students, even if they aren't old enough yet to vote, want change.

"Thoughts and prayers are not enough," said Kim Russell, Women's March executive adviser. "The school shootings just keep happening and happening. There's no escaping it. Congress need to hear from us."

The mass shooting at a Florida high school that left 17 people dead has sparked calls for walkouts, sit-ins and other actions on school campuses across the United States aimed at pushing lawmakers to pass tougher gun laws.

Organizers behind the Women's March, an anti-Trump and female empowerment protest, called for a 17-minute walkout on March 14 to "protest Congress' inaction to do more than tweet thoughts and prayers in response to the gun violence plaguing our schools and neighborhoods."

The Network for Public Education, an advocacy organization for public schools, meanwhile, announced a "national day of action" on April 20, the anniversary of the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado, in which two students opened fire on their classmates, killing 12 students and one teacher.

The organization is encouraging teachers and students to organize sit-ins, walkouts, marches and any other events to protest gun violence in schools.

"The politicians sit on their hands as our children and their teachers are murdered in their schools," Diane Ravitch, the group's president, and Carol Burris, its executive director, said in a post online.

The protest plans circulated widely on social media on Saturday, signaling that the outcry for new gun legislation may not fade away as it has after other recent mass shootings. Many of those shootings, including the deaths of 20 first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012, led to a push for new gun laws, but those efforts stalled in Congress.

"We need to make this moment a movement and to actually make changes that need to happen in this country so that these kinds of weapons, AR-15s, are not in the hands of people who shouldn't have them," said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, a union representing teachers and other educators.

Weingarten said she was part of the discussions about the April 20 protest. What gives the Florida shooting more potential to spark change, she said, is that the students themselves got angry really quickly and demanded it.

Teenage survivors of Wednesday's shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have become advocates for gun control, sparring with gun-rights activists on social media and calling for safer gun laws at vigils and in television interviews.

Thousands of angry students, parents and residents demanded stricter gun control laws on Saturday at a rally in Fort Lauderdale, which is about 20 miles from the site of the shooting in Parkland.

Some people in online posts called for a Civil Rights-era style boycott of schools until gun laws are changed. David Berliner, a professor of education at Arizona State University who also participated in the plans for the April 20 protest, said he would support such a boycott. He recalled watching a television news report about Wednesday's shooting at an airport.

"I'm crying, and I'm watching all the people all around me crying, and I just said, 'This has got to stop,'" he said.

Clare Schexnyder, a mother of a middle-school student in Decatur, Georgia, said she wants moms to take their kids out of school for a day to make a statement.

She said a private Facebook page she launched announcing a meeting of her Stop School Shootings group after the Florida shooting attracted more than 7,000 followers overnight.

Her protest is planned for March 14.

"President Trump talked about the American carnage in the United States. This is the American carnage," she said.

No amount of deference to the Second Amendment should have allowed Nikolas Cruz to keep his gun.

It would not have infringed on anyone’s right to bear arms had authorities responded to the bright red flags that were warning the Parkland, Fla. school shooter was about to go off his nut.

The opportunities for intervention were so numerous it’s almost impossible to digest that all of them were either missed or ignored.

No new laws were necessary to stop the murder of 17 students at Marjory Stoneman High School. What was needed was some action in response to the myriad clues Cruz was leaving that he was hell-bent on mayhem.

See something, say something? That’s what law enforcement agencies urge citizens to do. And it’s what Benjamin Bennight, a Mississippi bail bondsman and YouTube aficionado, did. He told the FBI that someone named Nikolas Cruz had posted a comment on his website declaring, “I’m going to be a professional school shooter.”

Agents apparently made a cursory investigation, but then let it drop before it led them to the Nikolas Cruz who’d been suspended from Stoneman for fighting — someone nearly everyone at the school predicted was a volcano waiting to erupt.

And what about the school? His fellow students all but voted Cruz “Most Likely to Slaughter Us.” An email was reportedly sent out after his suspension warning that if Cruz were seen near the school with a backpack, to not let him inside.

And yet he carried his backpack filled with loaded clips and an AR rifle to the school and waltzed right in the door.

How could the school have so easily washed its hands of Cruz? He was obviously a very disturbed young man, violent and rudderless. He’d just lost his mother, his only surviving parent.

Instead of tossing him out on the street when he got into a fight with a classmate, the school could have diverted him into a program that might have helped him deal with his demons.

Officials describe his internet footprint as “very, very troubling,” reflecting a fascination with guns and numerous threats to do mass carnage.

Broward County law enforcement officials were repeatedly called to Cruz’s home while he was growing up. Given his history, why did cops leave those encounters without Cruz’s gun in hand?

The family Cruz lived with knew he was troubled, and also knew he had a gun, and insisted he keep it in a locked cabinet. But a lock is worthless if the person you’re trying to keep the gun from has the key.

Responsible gun rights advocates, of which I am one, have no issue with stripping away ownership privileges from those who demonstrate a danger of using their guns for harm. We also live in this too violent country, and have children and grandchildren in its schools.

Prevention is not the same as pre-emption. It would not have required the sort of broad trampling of Second Amendment rights that gun controllers advocate to keep Cruz from his killing spree.

What was needed was greater diligence on the part of those who saw this threat building and could have acted to both help and disarm Nikolas Cruz, and failed to do so.

Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2HqZvtGI live in South Florida, just up the coast from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 students and teachers were gunned down and murdered Wednesday. I have a son in a school less than one hour from the high school where the shooting took place.

As someone trained in psychology who researches these topics all the time, this one hit too close to home. These victims are my kids’ friends, and my friends’ kids.

As soon as I learned about the shooting and determined that my own children were safe, I headed to the shooting site to comment on Fox News, as I often do after stories break where psychological answers are sought. I also wanted to talk to the students and see how I could be helpful.

I thought I would be pulled aside and tapped to listen to students and hear about how they were processing what they were feeling. But these kids had a different purpose: they wanted me to take a message to you that they thought the media was missing.

The students made one thing clear: They don’t want this shooting and their dead friends and faculty to be another flash-in-the-pan news story that changes nothing and is forgotten until the next shooting.

They want to be the catalyst to change so that this tragedy didn’t happen in vain, and they want the lives of their dead friends and faculty to mean something real and tangible.

As we try to make sense of the senseless, we can’t lose the voice of the voiceless in this.

The killer had his say. The media are having their say. The politicians will continue to have their voices heard in the months and years to come.

But what happens when the next story breaks and the people of Parkland are yesterday’s news?

Where are the victims’ families and the wounded who survived after the Oct. 1 Las Vegas mass shooting now? What ever happened in that investigation? What did we learn? What has changed since a gunman murdered 58 people and wounded hundreds before taking his own life?

What has changed since the massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado in April 1999, where 13 people were shot dead and the killers committed suicide?

To the students in Florida today, the answer is not enough. Clearly not enough, since school shootings keep happening.

What can we do?

Students told me they want meaningful change. Some spoke about guns, or mental health, but almost all recognized those are political answers to a problem that is spiritual. Most admitted frustration with the answers available.

One answer that the students seemed to take comfort in was the idea of focusing on prevention. They told me if this could be the last mass school schooling, then that would be meaningful to them.

How nice would it be if those on the right and those on the left could put all their politics aside – from the gun issue, to the mental health debate – and focus on what we can all agree on?

Many have suggested that we have retired military members in plain clothes protect our schools, like the air marshals who travel on some flights. Along with extensive airport security measures, the air marshals have prevented airline hijacking since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Funding is the obvious issue. What if that funding were inserted into the infrastructure bill? Who could argue with that? My friend suggested this to me, and I suggested this on “Hannity” Friday night, speaking from the site of the mass shooting.

Why not? Imagine for a moment if a history teacher was a highly trained, packing, protective, passionate, patriotic, plain-clothed veteran protecting our children.

We know the Florida killer wanted to live. That’s why he chose a gun-free zone with victims that he knew would be unprotected and unarmed. That’s why he walked right out of the crime scene and blended with the school kids, wearing their school hoodie to look like one of them. He wanted to escape.

If the gunman had known that there were retired military carrying protection mixed in with faculty, would he have chosen that school that day? Would any of the killing or injury even have occurred?

Killers kill. I know that. We know the gunman tortured animals and that is a horrendous symptom of sociopathy. But if he had not known the school was unprotected that day and how to amass his victims, would he have stuck to killing animals, or sought help in a stronger moment?

Since most of the carnage in such shootings happens within the first five minutes, hoping that police get there in time to save many lives is unrealistic. Solutions such as training and arming retired members of the military to provide security for schools is a newer idea that spares us the gun-control partisanship.

My prediction is that America is ready to do something about this, and I believe we will see President Trump pushing such measures. I am certainly hopeful.

The fact that the gunman is alive may shed some light on the psychology that we usually don’t have, because most of these shooters die or kill themselves at the end of these shootings.

Another advantage to capturing the shooter alive is that the survivors can see justice done through the criminal justice system, when they see the murderer convicted and sentenced in court. Court documents show that the teenager arrested after the shooting has confessed.

Let’s hope we can get more answers out of this killer, let’s pray justice prevails, and let’s act on new commonsense measures to ensure this never, ever happens again.A prominent GOP campaign donor has issued an ultimatum to Republican leaders: Introduce gun control legislation, or lose his support, the New York Times reported on Saturday.

Al Hoffman Jr., a leading donor to former President George W. Bush and Congressional Republicans, has vowed to halt all donations to the party unless leaders pass legislation to restrict access to guns and ban assault weapons, the publication said.

Seventeen people were slain and 14 people were hospitalized in Wednesday's rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Broward County. The suspect, troubled 19-year-old former student Nikolas Cruz, was booked on 17 counts of premeditated murder Thursday. Authorities said he used an AR-15 assault rifle.

"For how many years now have we been doing this — having these experiences of terrorism, mass killings — and how many years has it been that nothing's been done?" Mr. Hoffman told the New York Times. "It's the end of the road for me."

Hoffman issued his ultimatum via email, addressing half dozen Republican leaders. Those included Florida Gov. Rick Scott, whom he has supported in the past and who may seek a Senatorial seat in 2018, the Times reported. Representatives for Scott did not immediately return CNBC's request for comment.

"I will not write another check unless they all support a ban on assault weapons," he wrote in an email acquired by the Times. "Enough is enough!"

Republican leaders have shown little interest in new gun legislation, following the Feb. 14 attack at a Parkland, Florida, high school, according to the Times. A previous ban on assault weapons, signed into law in 1994 by President Bill Clinton, expired in 2004 under Bush.

Hoffman has also encouraged other donors to follow in his footsteps. However, the Times reported that certain donors, including Bush family ally Mel Sambler, have already expressed that they likely won't. Sembler did not immediately return CNBC's request for comment.

Why it matters: It's the first major pushback from an influential Republican urging lawmakers to support stricter gun control after the Parkland school shooting. And his money matters: He has given over $1 million to Right to Rise super PAC, which supported Jeb Bush’s 2016 campaign, and last spring he gave $25,000 to Mitch McConnell's Senate Leadership Fund.President Donald Trump on Saturday suggested the FBI was "spending too much time" on the Russia investigation when it failed to follow up on a tip about a man who would go on to kill 17 people at a Florida high school this week.

"Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable," Trump said in a Tweet shortly after 11 p.m.

"They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!" the president said on Twitter.

Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and any potential collusion with Trump campaign associates. On Friday the indictments of 13 Russian nationals were announced.

Trump's Saturday tweet came hours after survivors of Wednesday's shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School rallied against the gun lobby and called for gun control, and criticized Trump and others for offering what they said was little more than thoughts and prayers.

Alleged gunman Nikolas Cruz, 19, was arrested and has confessed to the shooting, according to a police affidavit. His state-appointed defense attorney said Friday that Cruz is willing to plead guilty to life without parole in order to be spared the possibility of a death sentence.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2018

Trump on Thursday morning on Twitter appeared to suggest that members of the community did not do enough to warn people of Cruz’s behavior. The FBI confirmed Friday that someone did warn the agency weeks before the shooting, but it wasn't properly followed up.

The FBI said Friday that someone who knew Cruz called an agency tip line on Jan. 5 and left information about Cruz's "gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting."

That tip should have been "assessed as a potential threat to life" and forwarded to the bureau's Miami field office for investigation, but "these protocols were not followed," the FBI said.

Trump's Saturday night tweet about the FBI, the shooting, and the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election comes a day after special counsel Robert Mueller announced the indictments of 13 Russian nationals.

The indictment says that some of those defendants "communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump Campaign."

The White House said in a statement the investigation indicates there was "NO COLLUSION" between the campaign and Russia. But the indictments did not clear the campaign, and Mueller's investigation continues.

Trump's Saturday night tweet wasn't the only one the president made that mentioned issues raised in the aftermath of the high school shooting, but which also seemed aimed at politics.

Earlier Saturday, after the rally held by survivors calling for action on guns, the president tweeted "why didn't the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate,” adding “Because they didn’t want to, and now they just talk!"
