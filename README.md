# Expanding Data for Gun Violence

## Inspiration
We realized that the lack of good data sets on gun violence is a major problem in the USA, and may be exasperating shootings. We saw that many of the online databases are relatively small and required user manual labor. Computer automation could significantly improve these data sets. 

## What it does
This program parses through articles in CNN, Google News, NY post, NBC news, Fox news, and the Gun Violence Archives (it can easily be expanded to other news sources). It identifies the articles that are discussing gun violence through newspaper and natural language processing and then transcribes the text of these articles to a text file. This text file is then analyzed using pattern recognition to extra critical information, including the shooter, victim, and city. This information can then be contributed to the gun-violence data base, which has tasks that include scanning headlines and identifying people.
